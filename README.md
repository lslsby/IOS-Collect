### 1. [A Cocoa library to extend the Objective-C programming language.](https://github.com/jspahrsummers/libextobjc)  
    The Extended Objective-C library extends the dynamism of the Objective-C pro
    gramming language to support additional patterns present in other programmin
    g languages (including those that are not necessarily object-oriented).  lib
    extobjc is meant to be very modular â€“ most of its classes and modules can be
    used with no more than one or two dependencies.  Please feel free to open is
    sues for feature requests or ideas for language extensions (even if you have
    no idea how they'd work)!

### 2. [A few code snippets from my Xcode arsenal http://nshipster.com/xcode-snippets/](https://github.com/Xcode-Snippets/Objective-C)  
    Just a few code snippets I have in my Xcode arsenal. In dotfiles fashion, I 
    thought it'd be cool to put these out in the ether.
